      An image query. Image data can be provided as raw bytes using 'input_bytes', by referencing
      a DICOM SOP Instance using `dicomweb_uri`, `gcs_uri` to reference a file on Google
      Cloud Storage (GCS) or by providing a URL to a public web server using 'image_url'. When
      referencing a DICOMWeb store or GCS, you may need to also provide `access_credential`; read
      more in the field description.

      For large digital pathology images:
      (1) You can optionally specify a list of rectangular regions of interest using
      `patch_coordinates_list`. When provided, the model will individually encode each specified
      patch into a separate embedding. Otherwise, a single embedding for the entire image will be
      generated.
      (2) For OpenSlide images stored on GCS, you can specify a specific layer using
      `openslide_pyramid_level`.

          image types (e.g. pathology slides) support patch coordinates.
